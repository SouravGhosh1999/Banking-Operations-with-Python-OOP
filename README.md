# Banking-Operations-with-Python-OOP
This is a fun project where I created a mini banking system using Python and a programming style called Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Think of OOP like building with LEGO blocks. Each block (called an object) has a job, and we connect them to make a complete system.
